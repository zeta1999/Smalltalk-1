## About this project

Some time ago I came accross Mario Wolczko's site (http://www.wolczko.com/st80) when searching for an original 
Smalltalk-80 implementation corresponding to the famous Smalltalk "Blue Book" (see http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/FreeBooks/BlueBook/Bluebook.pdf). 
I used Smalltalk in the nineties and also played around with Squeak and Pharo.
But I was surprised that there was no VM around capable of running the original Xerox images, which
Mario provides on this link: http://www.wolczko.com/st80/image.tar.gz. I wasn't able to load this image with
the aforementioned VMs; and even after numerous modifications, I still haven't managed to get the VM of Mario to work
(it now compiles but crashes before the image is fully loaded).

Since I recently completed an Oberon implementation based on LuaJIT (see https://github.com/rochus-keller/Oberon)
I got interested in the question whether it would be feasible to use LuaJIT as a backend for Smalltalk-80, and 
what performance it would achieve compared to Cog (see https://github.com/OpenSmalltalk/opensmalltalk-vm).
There are many similarities between Lua and Smalltalk, even though the syntax is very different. 
I see two implementation variants: run everything from the Smalltalk source code, or run it from the
Smalltalk image (i.e. Blue Book bytecode). To further analyze the Xerox implementation and make a decision
I needed a good tool, so here we are.

AND NOT TO FORGET: Smalltalk-80 turns 40 this year, and Alan Kay turns 80!


### A Smalltalk-80 parser and code model written in C++

Of course I could have implemented everything in Smalltalk as they did with the original Squeak and Cog VMs. But
over the years I got used to strictly/statically typed programming and C++ is my main programming language since
more than twenty years. And there is Qt (see https://www.qt.io/) which is a fabulous framework for (nearly) 
everything. And LuaJIT is written in C and Assembler. I therefore consider C++ a good fit.

Usually I start with an EBNF syntax and transform it to LL(1) using my own tools (see https://github.com/rochus-keller/EbnfStudio).
Smalltalk is different. There are syntax specifications available (even an ANSI standard), but there is a plethora
of variations. So I just sat down and wrote a lexer and then a parser and modified it until it could parse the
Smalltalk-80.sources file included with http://www.wolczko.com/st80/image.tar.gz. The parser feeds a code model
which does some additional validations and builds the cross-reference lists. On my old 32 bit HP EliteBook 2530p
the whole Smalltalk-80.sources file is parsed and cross-referenced in less than half a second. 

There is also an AST and a visitor which I will use for future code generator implementations.


### A Smalltalk-80 Class Browser written in C++

The Class Browser has a few special features that I need for my analysis. There is syntax highlighting of course
but it also marks all keywords of the same message and all uses of a declaration. If you click on the identifier
there is a tooltip with information whether it's a temporary, instance or class variable, etc. If you CTRL+click on a 
class identifier or on a message sent to an explicit class then it navigates to this class and method. There is also
a list with all methods of all classes where a variable is used or assigned to; other lists show all message patterns
or primaries used in the system and in which classes/methods they are implemented.
There is also a browsing history; you can go back or forward using the ALT+Left and ALT+Right keys.

### A Smalltalk-80 Image Viewer

With the Image Viewer one can inspect the contents of the original Smalltalk-80 Virtual Image in the
interchange format provided at http://www.wolczko.com/st80/image.tar.gz. The viewer presents the
object table in a tree; known objects (as defined in the Blue Book part 4) and classes are printed
by name; an object at a given oop can be expanded, so that object pointers can be followed; when clicking
on an object or its class the details are presented in html format with navigable links; by CTRL-
clicking on a list item or link a list or detail view opens with the given object as root. There is a
dedicated list with all classes and metaclasses found in the image, as well as a cross-reference list
from where a given oop is referenced. Detail views of methods also show bytecode with descriptions.
There is also a browsing history; you can go back or forward using the ALT+Left and ALT+Right keys.

### A Smalltalk-80 Virtual Machine

This is a Blue Book implementation and currently work in progress. The focus is on functionality and compliance with the Blue Book, not on performance (it performs decently though). The interpreter reproduces the original Xerox trace2 and trace3 files included with http://www.wolczko.com/st80/image.tar.gz. The initial screen after startup corresponds to the screenshot shown on page 3 of the "Smalltalk 80 Virtual Image Version 2" manual.

Here is a screenshot of the running VM immediately after startup:

### Binary versions

Here is a binary version of the Class Browser and Image Viewer for Windows: http://software.rochus-keller.info/St80Tools_win32.zip.
Just unpack the ZIP somewhere on your drive and double-click St80ClassBrowser.exe or St80ImageViewer.exe; Qt libraries are included as well as the 
original Smalltalk-80.sources and virtual image file.

### Build Steps

Follow these steps if you want to build the Class Browser yourself:

1. Make sure a Qt 5.x (libraries and headers) version compatible with your C++ compiler is installed on your system.
1. Download the source code from https://github.com/rochus-keller/Smalltalk/archive/master.zip and unpack it.
1. Goto the unpacked directory and execute `QTDIR/bin/qmake StClassBrowser.pro` (see the Qt documentation concerning QTDIR).
1. Run make; after a couple of seconds you will find the executable in the build directory.

Alternatively you can open StClassBrowser.pro using QtCreator and build it there.
